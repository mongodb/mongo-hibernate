# Hibernate ORM runs additional mapping contributors for any
# `org.hibernate.SessionFactory`/`jakarta.persistence.EntityManagerFactory` that is being bootstrapped.
# Consequently, this contributor must check that the involved dialect is `com.mongodb.hibernate.dialect.MongoDialect`,
# to avoid interfering with bootstrapping unrelated to the MongoDB Extension for Hibernate ORM.
