# Hibernate ORM initiates services on demand, so despite this service contributor being available to any
# `org.hibernate.SessionFactory`/`jakarta.persistence.EntityManagerFactory` that is being bootstrapped,
# its corresponding service will not be initiated until it is requested.
# That means, it will not interfere with bootstrapping unrelated to the MongoDB Extension for Hibernate ORM.
